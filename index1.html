        <h2>Reason for joining Altschool</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been a Tech Enthusiast, but I can't really brag of
          having a tech skills. That's the reason I joined
          <a href="index2.html" target="_blank">Altschool</a>. I'm keen about
          learning and mastering Web development. With that in mind, I'm taking
          Altschool's Frontend Developer course as one giant step closer to my
          goal.
        </p>

        <h2>What I plan to achieve with Altschool</h2>
        <p>
          By the end of my final semester at
          <a href="index2.html" target="_blank">Altschool</a>, I hope to have
          become a job-ready Frontend Developer. I also aspire to be one of the
          outstanding students. It's my dream to work for big companies like
          Google, Meta and IBM. I hope to achieve this with Altschool's
          training.
